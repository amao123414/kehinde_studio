    <!-- 1. General Policy -->
 <section id="general" class="space-y-4">
     <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white border-b border-oakley-primary pb-2">1. General Policy & Agreement</h2>
     <p>By commissioning work from Oakley's Creations (the "Artist"), you (the "Client") agree to the following terms. These terms 
are subject to change without prior notice, but any changes will not apply to commissions already secured with a deposit.</p>
     <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
         <li>The Client must be 18 years of age or older to enter into a commission agreement. If the Client is under 18, a parent 
or legal guardian must submit and sign the contract on their behalf.</li>
         <li>The Artist reserves the right to refuse any commission for any reason without explanation.</li>
         <li>The Artist is not responsible for any adverse reactions (e.g., allergies) related to the materials used in the finished 
product.</li>
     </ul>
 </section>
 <!-- 2. Quoting and Pricing -->
 <section id="pricing" class="space-y-4">
     <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white border-b border-oakley-primary pb-2">2. Quoting and Pricing</h2>
     <p>All prices listed on the website are *estimates only*. The final price will be determined by the complexity of the design, 
material costs, and any requested features (LEDs, complex patterns, etc.).</p>
     <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
         <li>Quotes are valid for 60 days. After 60 days, a new quote may be required to reflect current pricing and material costs.
</li>
         <li>Any significant changes requested by the Client after the deposit is paid may incur additional fees.</li>
     </ul>
 </section>
 <!-- 3. Payment and Deposits -->
 <section id="payment" class="space-y-4">
     <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white border-b border-oakley-primary pb-2">3. Payment and Deposits</h2>
     <p>A *non-refundable deposit* is required to secure your commission slot and is applied toward the final cost of the project. 
This deposit covers initial material sourcing and design time.</p>
     <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
         <li>*Deposit:* The required deposit amount will be specified in the quote and is non-refundable upon cancellation by the 
Client.</li>
         <li>*Payment Plans:* Flexible payment plans are available. Full payment must be received before work begins on the 
physical creation phase.</li>
         <li>*Failure to Pay:* If the Client fails to make scheduled payments without prior arrangement, the commission may be 
canceled, and all previous payments (excluding the non-refundable deposit) will be forfeit.</li>
     </ul>

 <!-- 4. The Commission Process & Queue -->
 <section id="process" class="space-y-4">
     <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white border-b border-oakley-primary pb-2">4. Commission Process</h2>
     <p>Commissions are completed in the order they were agreed upon and paid for. Estimated completion dates are subject to change 
due to unexpected delays (e.g., material shipping, conventions, illness).</p>
     <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
         <li>WIP (Work in Progress) Updates: The Client will receive updates and approval checks at key stages (e.g., modeling, base 
completion, furring start).</li>
         <li>Changes: Only minor changes that do not affect the quoted price or original concept are permitted after the physical 
creation has begun. Major changes will incur a fee and may extend the deadline.</li>
         <li>Cancellation by Artist: In the rare event the Artist must cancel the commission, a full refund, including the deposit, 
will be issued to the Client.</li>
     </ul>
